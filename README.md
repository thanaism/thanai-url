# ThanaiURL

## URLs can be made very short!

Go to [hy.gy](https://hy.gy) and give it a try!

## Why ThanaiURL?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Inspired by TinyURL, I decided to create a URL shortening service.
The best thing about ThanaiURL is that the name of the service is a play on the name of TinyURL.

I also tried to use a domain name that was as short as possible within the range of personal purchases, and this time I chose a domain name that was only 5 characters long, including the period.
This is truly domain-driven design. Just kidding.

## Supplemental Information

This application will be hosted on Azure Static Web Apps.
In the implementation and environment building for the main React application, the book [Riakuto!][0] was a GREAT help to me.
